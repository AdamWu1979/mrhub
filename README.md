This is the GitHub repository associated with the MR-Hub website - a platform to share information about open source software relevant to the [ISMRM](http://www.ismrm.org) community.

This version of the page was created during the recent [MRI-themed Hackathon](http://mrathon.github.io) and during the ISMRM meeting in Montreal. It is not quite ready yet to accept pull-requests to add new software - but if you have suggestions for additional features at this stage please add them to the 'issues' section.

Currently we are using the number of citations that [Semantic Scholar](http://semanticscholar.org) finds on the main paper associated with the software to allow sorting by a proxy metric related to 'impact' of the software. We realise that this is not a perfect solution, not least because not everyone who cites a paper uses the software - and not everyone who uses software has cited the paper. For now this seems like a reasonable solution - but feel free to use the 'issues' section to discuss any issues that arise due to this choice, along with any suggestions you might have for how to improve it.
