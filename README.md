This is the GitHub repository associated with the MR-Hub website - a platform to share information about open source software relevant to the [ISMRM](http://www.ismrm.org) community.

This version of the page was created during the recent [MRI-themed Hackathon](http://mrathon.github.io) and during the ISMRM meeting in Montreal. It is not quite ready yet to accept pull-requests to add new software - but if you have suggestions for additional features at this stage please add them to the 'issues' section.
